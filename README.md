# team-profile-generator


The main use case for this team profile generator is for a manager to be able to quickly create a template of what people will be in the managers team, their roles and information very quickly. It is also to collect all the teams information in one place for organisational purposes especially as the team starts to get larger. 

I created an initial employee class using the base parameters that would make up the rest of the subclasses. I then created a subclass for each of the manager intern and engineer including the extra parameters and methods for the extra information that is unique to them. I then imported those classes and subclasses into the index.js and then created multiples functions making use of the inquirer prompt within each one to get the users input and to create an intern or engineer after the manager is created.
